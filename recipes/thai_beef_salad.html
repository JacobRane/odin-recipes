        <li>1 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 stalk lemongrass, smashed and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sweet chili sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds (1 inch thick) steak fillet</li>
        <li>1 head leaf lettuce - rinsed, dried and torn into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>½ English cucumber, diced</li>
        <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
    </ul>    
    <ol>
        <li>Mix lime juice, cilantro, mint leaves, sugar, fish sauce, 
            green onions, lemongrass, and chili sauce together in a 
            large bowl until sugar is dissolved. Adjust the flavor, 
            if desired, by adding more sugar and/or fish sauce; set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the 
            grate.</li>  
        <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill until it begins to firm 
            and is hot and slightly pink in the center, about 4 to 6 
            minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
            the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li> 
        <li>Transfer steak to a chopping board and slice into thin strips; 
            add steak and its juices into the bowl with herb mixture. 
            Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.</li>   
        <li>Place lettuce in a salad bowl; arrange cucumber on top. 
            Add steak and pour all of the herb mixture on top. Scatter 
            cherry tomatoes over salad and garnish with fresh cilantro 
            leaves.</li>
